        <h1>Introduction to user consent management</h1>
        <section class="note">

            >This article is for anyone that sends data to Google and is
            collecting and managing user consent.</em

          Learn why and how you might need to manage user consent for Google
          Analytics, Google Ads, or Ads Data Hub.
        </p>
        <h3>Why manage user consent</h3>
        <p>
          Consumers increasingly expect to control the data they share about
          themselves, and Google provides tools for you to respect your users’
          choices. Websites and apps that use Google Analytics or Google Ads
          gather and store information about website visitor and app user
          behavior. Google also lets you upload data from other sources into
          Google Ads, for example by uploading store sales data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many countries and regions have laws that require advertisers to get
          users’ consent to store and share information about them. These laws
          vary by jurisdiction and change over time. It is your responsibility, as
          an advertiser, to understand the laws that affect you and to implement
          consent management solutions for any data you share with Google.
        </p>
        <section class="note">
          <em
            >Websites use cookies to store information, while apps use app
            identifiers rather than cookies. However, many people refer to all
            stored information as cookies. Hence, you might see the shorthand term
            cookie consent to talk about getting user consent for both websites
            and apps. Similarly, the term cookie banner is often used to refer to
            all consent management solutions.</em
